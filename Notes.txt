Why we are creating the types.d.ts file?
    --> The reason we are creating this file is beacuse to connect the mongodb with our applicaiton we are require
        to have a connection. to make that connection. we need to have this file. If we are using JS we don't need  
        make this file but since we are using  the typescript we have to have that file. 


** And the reason we are able to use the global object anywhere in the code becaouse we have the tsconfig file 
    in our project. **

******NEXT AUTH******
Next auth is very complex thing to understand. first of all you have to create the next-auth.d.ts file 
this is file is responsible for the declaring the mudule named next-auth. to be honest i still not get it the 
whole process of how the next auth work but i am trying. 
Then in the auth.ts file  we have create the providers , callbacks , pages and session and secret objects.
providers are like the source of the info about the user. the logic checking if the user is logged in or not is stored
in the providers. 
then callbacks : - callbacks are basically tell the code that what should we do when the login function takes the 
place. what should happen after the login is written in callbacks.
