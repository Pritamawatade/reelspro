Why we are creating the types.d.ts file?
    --> The reason we are creating this file is beacuse to connect the mongodb with our applicaiton we are require
        to have a connection. to make that connection. we need to have this file. If we are using JS we don't need  
        make this file but since we are using  the typescript we have to have that file. 


** And the reason we are able to use the global object anywhere in the code becaouse we have the tsconfig file 
    in our project. **

******NEXT AUTH******
    Next auth is very complex thing to understand. first of all you have to create the next-auth.d.ts file 
    this is file is responsible for the declaring the mudule named next-auth. to be honest i still not get it the 
    whole process of how the next auth work but i am trying. 
    Then in the auth.ts file  we have create the providers , callbacks , pages and session and secret objects.
    providers are like the source of the info about the user. the logic checking if the user is logged in or not is stored
    in the providers. 
    then callbacks : - callbacks are basically tell the code that what should we do when the login function takes the 
    place. what should happen after the login is written in callbacks.

    So the whole process of next auth is look like this. 
    first of all after insalling next-auth. 
    you need to create the next-auth.d.ts file that will declare the types for the session and user.
    then our next job is create the providers. --> in providers basically there are logic of checking if the user
    exist or checking if the password and email is right and wrong. 
    after we need to create the callbacks. as the name suggest callbacks are functions that run after happening something
    in callbacks session and jwt two methods take place.
    after that pages ,  session and secret are the objects that need to be created.
